# Hyperchromatic

## An open source P3/OKLCH color palette

Hex and rgb colors on the web are limited to the sRGB range of colors
supported by older displays. Hyperchromatic is an open source palette using
[OKLCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch)
for colors in the wider P3 range that modern displays support.
